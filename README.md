# Winning the space race with Data Science

The following methodologies were used to analyze data:

<h3>Data Collection using web scraping and SpaceX API</h3>
  â€¢ Data sets were collected from Space X API (https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/rockets/) and
from Wikipedia
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon/_9/_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches), using
web scraping technics.

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including data wrangling, data visualization and
interactive visual analytics</h3>

<h2>Summary of all results</h2>

It was possible to collected valuable data from public sources;
EDA allowed to identify which features are the best to predict success of
launchings;
Machine Learning Prediction showed the best model to predict which
characteristics are important to drive this opportunity by the best way, using all
collected data to add text
